# Imgur Archive for Android

A native Android application to find and download archived images and videos from Imgur using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

This project is a complete port and enhancement of an original Python/Tkinter desktop application, rebuilt from the ground up using React Native.

## Features

-   **Media Preview**: Displays a preview of the last downloaded image.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, tab-based interface for easy navigation.
