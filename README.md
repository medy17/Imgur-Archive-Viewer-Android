# Imgur Archive for Android

A native Android application to find and download archived images and videos from Imgur using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

This project is a complete port and enhancement of an original Python/Tkinter desktop application, rebuilt from the ground up using React Native.

-   **Modern UI**: A clean, tab-based interface for easy navigation.
